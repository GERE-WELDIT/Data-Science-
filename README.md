# Data Science Internship Projects with Ureka Education Group.

Data Science intern projects with python codes & Jupyter notebook.

**Project 1**: Sensors data -- find the most predictive features / feature importance using machine learning.

**Project 2**: Employee attrition -- finding features that causes the employees leaving the company.

**Project 3**: Natural language processing and text mining/modelling using AirBnb housing data. The goal was to analyze all the texts and to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, LDA , LSA, and Word2Vec to see some features or clustering similar documents about the text data.
