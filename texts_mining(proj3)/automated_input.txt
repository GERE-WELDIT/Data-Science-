Marcus is a brilliant, warm and friendly host. He picked us up from the
railway station, he took Anne to the doctor, and drove us around
wherever we needed to go in Bristol and dropped us back at the 
railway station when we were leaving. 
His flat is very modern, comfortable and clean and is very well heated. 
Marcus provided us with everything we could wish for. 
We wish we could have stayed longer!!
